<h1>SimpleXacml</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Implements a simle xacml architecture in .NET</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Large enterprises have complex authorization needs which opens the door to look at standards compliant authorization standards, to achieve these needs they also have large budgets. </p>

<p>There are no really 'easy' ways to achieve complex authorization in a simple .NET application without using a large vendor product. So, to fulfill the need and as a learning project, the SimpleXacml implementation was created. </p>
