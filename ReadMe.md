SimpleXacml
===========
Overview
--------
Implements a stripped down version of xcaml in .NET

Purpose
-------
Large enterprises have complex authorization needs which opens the door to look at standards compliant authorization standards, to achieve these needs they also have large budgets. 

There are no really 'easy' ways to achieve complex authorization in a simple .NET application without using a large vendor product. So, to fulfill the need and as a learning project, the SimpleXacml implementation was created.
